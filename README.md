# AF2MAT-MAT2AF
Conversion functions to help pass data between ArrayFire's `af::array` object and OpenCV's `cv::Mat`. In this Qt project we demonstrate possibility to pass grayscale (fingerprint) image data from `af::array` to `cv::Mat` and vice-versa. It is very common to use both ArrayFire and OpenCV library in image processing applications and therefore we find it helpful to provide these conversion functions.

This project depends on these 3rd-party libraries:
* ArrayFire 3.5.1 (tested)
* OpenCV 3.4.1 (tested)
